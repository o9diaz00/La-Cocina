    <h2>Sobre el Chef (About Me)</h2>
    <div class = "card">
      <p>Hola todos!  I am Ottis, SRE/Devops/Cloud Engineer by day, normal citizen trying to recuperate from work by night.</p>
      <p>When I do have time to myself, I like to learn (or try to) new languages (case in point the Spanish here, but there is also Japanese too), do puzzles/escape rooms, play sports and video games.  If you've come across the moniker "ChefBoyRD" dominating any of your online games, that was probably me! (and now all of a sudden this website's theme is starting to all come together now)</p>
